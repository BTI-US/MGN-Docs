# What is MGN

![icon](../.gitbook/assets/1648823283822.jpg)

The world's largest virtual currency lottery platform, a happy metaverse game set with hash blocks as a unique standard.

## Hash

A block hash is the DNA of a piece of data, and each block hash is unique, random, and unbreakable.

Hash algorithm is a generalized algorithm, which can also be regarded as an idea. Using Hash algorithm can improve the utilization of storage space, improve the efficiency of data query, and can also make digital signatures to ensure the security of data transmission. So Hash algorithm is widely used in Internet applications.

## Blockchain

Blockchain is essentially a shared database in which data or information is stored. It has the characteristics of non-forgery, full traces, traceability, openness and transparency, and collective maintenance.

## MGN

Every transfer between decentralized exchanges will generate a block hash value. When you transfer 1 token to a certain wallet address, a series of hash values that cannot be tampered with are generated on the blockchain. , our contract will automatically identify whether this hash value meets our winning conditions. If the transfer is consistent with the winning conditions, then the smart contract will automatically return the winning tokens. All of this is automatically executed by the contract and cannot be manually intervened. Integrity, fairness and safety.
