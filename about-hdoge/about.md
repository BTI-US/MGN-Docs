# About

HASH is an algorithm, you give it a string of numbers, and it returns you a string of numbers. What you give it is called "input", and what it gives you is called "output". That is to say, the data is output to the HASH function, and the HASH function outputs a series of numbers.

The uniqueness and irreversibility of the HASH algorithm have made us very interested in it, and everything is traceable on the chain. Integrity, security, and stability are all executed by smart contracts without human intervention, which will replace the real lottery system mechanism.

In reality, the lottery is more or less artificially controlled by people, but for HashDoge, we advocate that contracts should be used instead of people to execute.
